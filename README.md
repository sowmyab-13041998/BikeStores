### Project Background
The BikeStore database is a hypothetical database for a bike shop, containing information about products, customers, orders, and sales. In this project, I have analyzed the database to gain insights into customer behavior and product performance.

### Tools Used
For this project, I have used the following tools:

* SQL: To query and analyze the BikeStore database.
* Excel: To pivot and analyze the data.
* Tableau: To create a dynamic dashboard to visualize the insights gained from the analysis.
### Database Analysis
Using SQL, I have queried the BikeStore database to gain insights into customer behavior and product performance. Some of the queries I have written include:

The total revenue generated by the store
The top-selling products by revenue and quantity
The top-spending customers
The average order value by month
I have documented the queries and their results in the queries.sql file.

### Excel Pivoting
After analyzing the database using SQL, I have used Excel to pivot and analyze the data further. In particular, I have used Excel to analyze customer behavior and product performance.

Some of the analyses I have performed in Excel include:

The total revenue and quantity sold by product category
The number of customers by country
The number of orders and revenue by month
I have documented the pivots and their results in the excel_pivots.xlsx file.

### Tableau Dashboard
Using Tableau, I have created a dynamic dashboard to visualize the insights gained from the analysis. The dashboard includes:

A map showing the number of customers by country
A bar chart showing the top-selling products by revenue
A line chart showing the total revenue and orders by month
A scatter plot showing the relationship between order quantity and revenue
The dashboard is interactive and allows the user to filter and drill down into the data. You can view the dashboard by opening the dashboard.twb file in Tableau.

### Conclusion
This project showcases my skills in SQL, Excel, and Tableau. By analyzing the BikeStore database and creating a dynamic dashboard, I have gained insights into customer behavior and product performance, which can help the bike shop make data-driven decisions. I hope you find this project impressive and thank you for viewing my profile.
